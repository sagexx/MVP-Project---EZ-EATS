First group project in bootcamp completed. 
Fully functional restaurant finding app that has two responsive APIs. 
The first is a geolocator that fetches the users location which determines what restaurants are shown to the user.
The second is a restaurants API that finds restaurants given a longitude and latitude value.
Our result was an app that with the click of a button, gives a list of details and directions to every restaurant in 30 miles sorted by ranking.
